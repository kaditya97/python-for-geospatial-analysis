    "GeoPandas is a Python library that extends the capabilities of Pandas to support geospatial data. It provides a set of functions for working with spatial data, including reading and writing various geospatial file formats, performing spatial operations, and visualizing geospatial data. Here are some of the basic functions in GeoPandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading and Writing Spatial Data:**\n",
    "   - `read_file()`: Read geospatial data from a file (e.g., shapefile, GeoJSON) and return a GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "   - `to_file()`: Write a GeoDataFrame to a file in a specified format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Exploration:**\n",
    "   - `head()`: View the first few rows of the GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "   - `info()`: Get summary information about the GeoDataFrame, including column names, data types, and geometries.\n",
    "   - `plot()`: Visualize the GeoDataFrame using matplotlib or other plotting libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Operations:**\n",
    "   - `geometry`: Access and manipulate the geometry column of the GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "   - `buffer()`: Create a buffer around geometries.\n",
    "   - `centroid()`: Compute the centroid of geometries.\n",
    "   - `intersection()`: Find the intersection between two GeoDataFrames.\n",
    "   - `union()`: Compute the union of geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Joins and Overlay:**\n",
    "   - `sjoin()`: Perform a spatial join between two GeoDataFrames based on their spatial relationships.\n",
    "   - `overlay()`: Compute the spatial overlay between two GeoDataFrames, creating new geometries based on intersection, union, or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attribute Filtering and Querying:**\n",
    "   - `loc[]`: Filter rows based on attribute conditions.\n",
    "   - `query()`: Filter rows based on a SQL-like query expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS):**\n",
    "   - `crs`: Access and modify the coordinate reference system of the GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "   - `to_crs()`: Reproject the GeoDataFrame to a different CRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregation and Grouping:**\n",
    "   - `groupby()`: Group GeoDataFrame by one or more columns.\n",
    "   - `agg()`: Compute aggregated statistics on grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exporting and Importing Geometries:**\n",
    "   - `geopandas.GeoSeries()`: Create a GeoSeries from a list of geometries.\n",
    "   - `shapely.geometry`: Import Shapely geometry types and functions for creating and manipulating geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the basic functions available in GeoPandas. The library provides a rich set of functionalities for geospatial data manipulation and analysis. For more detailed information, you can refer to the GeoPandas documentation (https://geopandas.org/) and explore the available methods and attributes for GeoDataFrames and GeoSeries."
